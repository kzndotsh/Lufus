## Beta Release

**lufus** is currently in **Beta**.

It is a physical drive imaging and formatting utility written in Python, inspired by **Rufus**, with the goal of delivering a greater experience for Linux users.

While core functionality is being implemented and refined, the project is still under active development. Users should expect bugs, incomplete features, and ongoing structural changes.

If you rely on stable, production-grade imaging tools, consider established alternatives until lufus reaches a stable release.

## Aim

lufus aims to:

* Simplify bootable media creation for  Linux users
* Provide a clean, minimal, and accessible interface

## Running Lufus

Currently, running the project can be done by installing briefcase in a venv with
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install briefcase
```
Cloning the project, and running `briefcase run -r` in the root directory

## Documentation
Lufus uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for its documentation.
To build the docs locally, simply `pip install mkdocs` in the venv and run `mkdocs build`,
or `mkdocs serve` to run a dev server.
