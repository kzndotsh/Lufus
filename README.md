## Beta Release

**Lufus** is currently in **Beta**. 

It is a physical drive imaging and formatting utility written in Python, inspired by **Rufus** on Windows, with the goal of delivering a greater experience for Linux users.
While core functionality has been implemented, the project is still under active development. Users should expect bugs, incomplete features, and ongoing structural changes.

## Aim

Lufus aims to:

* Simplify bootable media creation for  Linux users (new and old alike)
* Provide a clean, minimal, and accessible interface for users
* Become an all in one hub for everything-flashing on Linux and provide features not offered yet by its counterparts
* Allow users freedom and control over their Windows installs (in works)
* and much more

## Running Lufus

Currently, running the project can be done by installing briefcase in a venv with
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install briefcase
```
Clone the project, and run the following in the root directory of the project:
```briefcase dev -r```

## Documentation
Lufus uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for its documentation.
To build the docs locally, simply `pip install mkdocs` in the venv and run `mkdocs build`,
or `mkdocs serve` to run a dev server.
